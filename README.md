Each version of the model contains comments in the code in the form of ``MODIFICATIONS`` comments, which explain what modifications are made and where, with respect to the previous version.
I.e., V2 contains comments about changes w.r.t. V1, V3 w.r.t. V2 etc...

The following model versions can be found in the following directories:
* V1: CPM_Targets
* V2: CPM_Targets_New_Movement
* V3: CPM_Targets_New_Movement_Death_with_Markers
* V4: CPM_Targets_New_Movement_Death_with_Markers_Population_Distributions
