# Contractile Particle Model (CPM)

This directory contains the CPM model as described in the paper "Continuous-space automaton model for pedestrian dynamics" by Gabriel Baglietto and Daniel R. Parisi.
The model is made with javascript in order to facilitiate easy visualizations with HTML, without requiring the installation of any additional software.
To run the simulation, simply open the `simulation.html` file in your web browser (only tested on Microsoft Edge) and click the start button.
